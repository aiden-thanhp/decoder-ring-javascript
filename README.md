# decoder-ring-javascript

This is a project I have with Thinkful course - using Javascript to build functions for encoding and decoding some algorithms. Using Array class and its function including reduce, map, find, filter, and create other functions to be used in the main function to minimize repetition of codes.

You can also find a full project that I used ReactJS to build a full front-end website at https://github.com/aiden-thanhp/decoder-ring.
